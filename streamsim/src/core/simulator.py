Multi-Threaded Streaming Simulator

This module provides a general-purpose framework for real-time visualization and
analysis of streaming time-series data, featuring a producer-consumer architecture
with pluggable components for feature extraction and change point detection.

Architecture:
    The simulator employs a dual-thread design: a background worker thread
    continuously pulls data from a source, derives features, and runs change
    point detection, pushing results to a thread-safe queue. The main thread
    consumes queued updates and renders via an animated visualization, ensuring
    UI responsiveness independent of processing load.

Use Cases:
    - Real-time sensor monitoring with live anomaly visualization
    - Educational demonstrations of signal processing pipelines

Important Dependencies:
    - threading: Background processing thread
    - queue.Queue: Thread-safe communication between producer and consumer
    - collections.deque: Efficient circular buffers for history management
    - matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation: Animated rendering engine
    - streamsim.src.core.interfaces: Pluggable component interfaces
    - streamsim.src.core.config.PlottingSetup: Visualization configuration

    
Example:    
    >>> sim = StreamingSimulator(
    ...    plotting_setup=setup,
    ...    feature_deriver=deriver,
    ...    change_point_detector=detector,
    ...    renderer=renderer,
    ...    data_source=sinus_source,
    ...    window_duration_sec=5.0,  
    ...    max_history=5000,         
    ...    interval_ms=100           
    )
    >>> sim.start()
    # [Matplotlib window opens with live streaming visualization]

        1. **Queue Consumption**: Drains up to 200 pending messages from the thread-safe
           queue, aggregating data into internal circular buffers.
        2. **Buffer Management**: Appends incoming samples, timestamps, features, and
           change point markers to their respective deques.
        3. **Data Preparation**: Converts buffered data into NumPy arrays suitable for
           efficient rendering.
        4. **Visualization Update**: Delegates to the configured `StreamingRenderer`
           to refresh the plot with the latest data and detected change points.
        5. **Viewport Adjustment**: Updates the x-axis limits to maintain a sliding
           window view centered on the most recent data.

        Launches the streaming simulation and enters the main event loop.

        This method initializes and starts both the background processing thread
        and the matplotlib animation engine, coordinating the full simulation
        pipeline from data ingestion to real-time visualization.

        Initialization Steps:
            1. Sets the `is_running` flag to True, enabling the worker thread.
            2. Spawns a daemon thread executing `_processing_loop` for continuous
               data acquisition, feature derivation, and change point detection.
            3. Configures the `FuncAnimation` engine with the plotting setup,
               binding `_update_plot` as the frame callback and `_init_plot`
               for initial render state.
            4. Enters the matplotlib main loop via `plt.show()`, blocking until
               the window is closed or `stop()` is called.

        Threading Model:
            - Worker thread: Handles all data processing and queue production
            - Main thread: Manages GUI rendering and queue consumption
            - Both threads communicate via a thread-safe `Queue` instance

        Lifecycle:
            The simulation runs indefinitely until:
            - The user closes the plot window
            - `stop()` is called programmatically
            - The data source signals completion (returns None)

        Terminates the streaming simulation and releases resources.

        This method initiates a clean shutdown sequence for both the background
        processing thread and the matplotlib animation engine, ensuring all
        resources are properly released and no orphaned threads remain.

        Shutdown Sequence:
            1. Sets `is_running` to False, signaling the worker thread to exit
               its processing loop on the next iteration.
            2. Waits for the processing thread to join with a 1-second timeout,
               allowing it to finish any in-flight operations.
            3. Stops the `FuncAnimation` event source to halt frame callbacks.
            4. Invokes the renderer's cleanup routine to release any allocated
               graphics resources or figure handles.

        Thread Safety:
            This method is thread-safe and can be called from any thread. It
            uses the shared `is_running` flag to coordinate shutdown with the
            background worker, avoiding race conditions or deadlocks.

        Post-Execution State:
            After `stop()` completes:
            - The processing thread is terminated (or timed out)
            - The animation engine is halted
            - Internal buffers retain their last state (call `reset()` if needed)
            - The plot window remains open until manually closed

        Note:
            Always call `stop()` before closing the application to prevent
            resource leaks or hanging threads. For a fresh start, call `reset()`
            on components before invoking `start()` again.
