class StreamingFeatureDeriver(ABC):

    Abstract base class for real-time feature extraction from streaming data.
    
    This class defines the interface for components that process incoming data
    samples sequentially to derive meaningful features (e.g., statistical metrics,
    signal characteristics, or event detections). Implementations maintain internal
    state to compute features incrementally without needing to store the entire
    history of raw data.
    
    Methods:
        add_sample(sample, timestamp): Feed a new data point into the processor.
        get_feature(): Retrieve the most recently calculated feature value.
        reset(): Clear all internal state and buffers.

    Abstract base class for detecting distribution shifts (change points) in streaming data.
    
    This class defines the interface for algorithms that monitor a sequence of feature
    values and identify moments where the underlying statistical properties of the
    data change significantly (e.g., mean shift, variance change, concept drift).
    
 
    Attributes:
        drift_detected (bool): Property indicating if a change point was recently detected.

        outcome of the most recent `update()` call or the cumulative state
        depending on the implementation strategy.

    preparation from the rendering engine, allowing for efficient updates
    without redrawing the entire figure.
    
    Methods:
        initialize(ax): Set up the initial plot structure on the provided axes.
